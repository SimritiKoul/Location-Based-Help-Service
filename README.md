# Location-Based-Help-Service
The main motivation behind making this project is the belief that equal opportunity is the
cornerstone of civilization. All human beings must have the same opportunity to succeed
in life, irrespective of the circumstances they were born into. The idea of wecare was born
very simple to bridge the gap between two sets of people- people who want to give,
people who want to try and make a difference along with those who are doing
phenomenal work but donâ€™t know how to reach out to people who want to support them.
India is population rich. Our people are our resources and if each one of us commits to
giving regularly, we will be strong enough to solve our problems. We could even be
audacious enough to say that we as a community may not need any aid if we make giving
a way of life.
The main aim of this project is to connect people all over the world who can help people
in need without even knowing them or expecting something in return. People can put up
donations which includes food and nutrition, medicines, books, clothes, home appliances,
furniture etc. so that people in need can acquire it for free. Mission of this website is to
promote efficient and effective giving that provides greater opportunities to the poor in
India.
